# Taco-Tracker
A restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat. The application has the ability to store the taco lists and update them on the fly after you've "eaten" them.

## Instructions
Save the GitHub repository onto your local computer. Pull up your command line interface and navigate to the folder where you saved the repository. Before using, type "npm install" to install the packages into your repository that you will need to run to your local host. Open a browser and navigate to your localhost on PORT 8080 to see the main screen.

Once you are in the app, click the EAT button on a taco to the left to change the status to eaten. If the tacos have been replenished, click the RESTOCK button to change them back to the available section. If you'd like to add your own custom taco, type in the taco name and click the ADD button to see it on the menu!
